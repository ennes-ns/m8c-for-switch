# m8c for Nintendo Switch

## Introduction

This is a custom fork of *m8c*, the client for the Dirtywave M8 Tracker's headless mode, with the goal of porting it to the Nintendo Switch using the [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) toolchain.

The original *m8c* provides a cross-platform solution for interfacing with the M8 headless firmware. This fork is specifically aimed at running on the Switch under homebrew conditions.

## Status

- **Current Goal**: Successfully compile and run *m8c* on Nintendo Switch homebrew.
- **Work in Progress**: Initial setup and adaptation of code for the Switch environment.

## Notes

- This is a work-in-progress and not all features are guaranteed to work yet.
